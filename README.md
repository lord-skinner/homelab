## Important Notice

**June 1, 2025**: NFS storage is temporarily disabled due to the unavailability of the storage node. All applications have been modified to use ephemeral storage (`emptyDir`) instead of persistent volumes. See [STORAGE_WORKAROUND.md](./STORAGE_WORKAROUND.md) for details on the changes made and how to restore persistent storage once the node is available again.
